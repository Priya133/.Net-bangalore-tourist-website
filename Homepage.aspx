                    term. The word Bengalooru was in turn derived from the phrase &#39;bende kaalu 
                    ooru&#39;, meaning &#39;the town of boiled beans&#39;. There is story behind naming the city 
                    as the &#39;town of boiled beans&#39;. It is said that King Ballala of the Hoysala 
                    dynasty once got lost in the jungle and was very tired and hungry. In the 
                    jungle, he came across a poor and old woman, who offered him some boiled beans. 
                    As an expression of his gratitude towards the woman, the King named the place as 
                    &#39;bende kaalu ooru&#39;. However, there are other historical evidences that reveal 
                    that the name &#39;Bengalooru&#39; was recorded much before the reign of King Ballala.

                    once saw his dog being chased by a hare. Amused as well as impressed up this

                    with the help of King Achutaraya, built a mud fort in Bangalore and inside it

                    <span style="color: #FFFFFF">In the year 1638, the Vijayanagara Empire fell to 
                    the Sultan of Bijapur, Mohammed Adil Shah. For the next sixty years, the city 
                    was under the rule of the Sultans. Thereafter, Mughals took over the city. 
                    However, their rule did not last too long and in 1687, they sold the kingdom to 
                    King Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar of Mysore. He got another fort built in Bangalore, 
                    to the south of the one built by Kempe Gowda. Hyder Ali received Bangalore in 
                    the form of jagir in 1759, from Krishna Raja Wodeyar II. He converted the city 
                    into an army town. In the year 1799, when Tipu Sultan died, the British returned 
                    the kingdom back to Krishna Raja Wodeyar III. However, the British again took 
                    over the kingdom in 1831, citing misrule by Krishna raja Wodeyar III as the 
                    reason. It was under the British rule that Bangalore started developing into a 
                    modern city, with all the contemporary facilities like railways, telegraphs, 
                    post and telegraph, etc. The city was again given back to the Wodeyars in 1881. 
                    However, since the British Commissioners were based in Bangalore, its 
                    development into a contemporary city continued unabated.</span>
