            <span style="color: white">Bannerghatta National Park near Bangalore, Karnataka, southern India, was 
            founded in 1971 and declared as a national park in 1974. In 2002 a portion of 
            the park, became a biological reserve, the Bannerghatta Biological Park. It is a 
            popular tourist destination with a zoo, a pet corner, an animal rescue centre, a 
            butterfly enclosure, an aquarium, a snake house and a safari park. There are 
            ancient temples in the park for worship and it is a destination for trekking. 
            The Zoo Authority of Karnataka, the University of Agricultural Sciences, 
            Bangalore, and the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE) 
            are collaborating agencies. Within the national park area are six rural villages 
            enclosed within three large enclosures for sheep and cattle farming.</span><br

                running through the park, originates in the Suvarnamukhi hills. These hills 
                spread out to a huge rock, about a kilometre long. The Champaka Dharna Swamy 
                temple built in the Dravidian style of the Hoysala age, lies at the foot of the 
                rock. The temple enshrines an image of Vishnu with his consorts Sridevi and 
                Bhudevi. The Suvarnamukhi hill also houses a small shrine dedicated to 
                Narasimha, and two km away is the Suvarnamukhi pond. The waters of this pond are 
                believed to have curative powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
