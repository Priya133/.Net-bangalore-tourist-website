                <span lang="EN-US" style="color: #FFFFFF">Hyder Ali commissioned the building of this garden in 1760 
                but his son, Tipu Sultan, completed it. Hyder Ali decided to create this garden 
                on the lines of the Mughal Gardens that were gaining popularity during his time. 
                Hyder Ali laid out these famous botanical gardens and his son added 
                horticultural wealth to them by importing trees and plants from several 
                countries. Hyder Ali deployed people from Thigala Community who were extremely 
                good in gardening.The Lal Bagh Gardens were commissioned by the 18th century and 
                over the years it acquired India&#39;s first lawn-clock and the subcontinent&#39;s 
                largest collection of rare plants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                <span lang="EN-US" style="color: #FFFFFF">The Lal Bagh Gardens are based on the design of the Mughal 
                Gardens that once stood at Sira, at a distance of 120&nbsp;km from Bengaluru on the 
                main NH4 at Tumkur District in Karnataka. This is amply supported by ASI 
                (Archaeological Survey of India) and other historical records. At that time, 
                Sira was the headquarters of the strategically important southernmost Mughal 
                &quot;suba&quot; (province) of the Deccan before the British Raj.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            1874, Lal Bagh had an area of 45 acres (180,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>). In 1889, 30 
            acres were added to the eastern side, followed by 13 acres in 1891 including the 
            rock with Kempegowda tower and 94 acres more in 1894 on the eastern side just 
            below the rock bringing it to a total of 188 acres (760,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>). The 
            foundation stone for the Glass House, modelled on London&#39;s Crystal Palace was 
            laid on 30 November 1898 by Prince Albert Victor and was built by John Cameron, 
            the then superintendent of Lalbagh.</span></span></td>
