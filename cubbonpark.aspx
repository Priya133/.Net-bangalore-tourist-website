                located within the heart of city in the Central Administrative Area. Originally 
                created in 1870, when Major General Richard Sankey was the then British Chief 
                Engineer of Mysore state </span>

                area of 100 acres and subsequent expansion has taken place and the area reported 
                now is about 300 acres It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and 
                fauna plantations coupled with numerous impressive and aesthetically located 
                buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts.<sup> </sup>This 
                public park was first named as “Meade’s Park” after Sir John Meade, the acting 
                Commissioner of Mysore in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the 
                longest serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the 
                Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s rule in Mysore State, in the year 
                1927, the park was again renamed as &quot;Sri. Chamarajendra Park&quot;, in memory of the 
                19th Century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868 – 94) during 
                whose rule the park came into existence. The landscaping in the park creatively 
                integrates natural rock outcrops with thickets of trees, massive bamboos, with 
                grassy expanse and flowerbeds and the monuments within its limits, regulated by 
                the Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka. The predominantly 
                green area of the park has many motorable roads, and the well laid out walking 
                paths running through the park are frequented by early morning walkers and the 
                naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
