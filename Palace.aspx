                    palace with a floor area of 45,000 sq ft (4200 m²). The palace and the grounds 
                    surrounding it are spread across 454 acres (183 ha).British officials who were 
                    in charge of the education of the young prince HH Chamaraja Wodeyar bought the 
                    palace in 1873 A.D. from him at a cost of Rs. 40,000 and later renovated it. The 
                    palace was built in Tudor style architecture with fortified towers, battlements 
                    and turrets. The interiors were decorated with elegant wood carvings, floral 
                    motifs, cornices and relief paintings on the ceiling. The furniture, which was 
                    neo-classical, Victorian and Edwardian in style, was bought from John Roberts 
                    and Lazarus. Maharaja&#39;s only son Srikanta Datta Narsimharaja Wadiyar

                    deal. But the Maharaja HH Jayachamarjendra Wodeyar died in 1974. The legal 
                    battle continued and in the mean time Srikanta Datta Narsimharaja Wadiyar gave 
                    28 acres (110,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) each to his five sisters namely Late Gayatri 
                    Devi, Meenakshi Devi, Kamakashi Devi, Indrakshi Devi and Vishalakshi Devi in 
                    1983 along the Ramana Mahasrhi Road. They are in possession of their respective 
                    portion and many events like Rock shows, exhibitions, marriages, tennis, 
                    cricket, golf and horse academies are conducted in those portions. Srikanta 
                    Datta Narsimharaja Wadiyar ultimately compromised with the Chamaraju Group in 
                    the years 1990 and 1994, and got back his portion of the property including the 
                    Main Palace except 45 acres (180,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>), which the Chamaraju group 
                    still retains along the Jayamahal Road. This will be a landmark decision as 
                    otherwise it will open flood gates of vexatious legislation to confiscate 
                    similar properties all over the Country without paying even a fraction of market 
                    value. This is in quite contrast to new Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and 
                    Resettlement Bill, 2013 recently passed by the Indian Parliament.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
